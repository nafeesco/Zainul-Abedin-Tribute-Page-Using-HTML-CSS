        <p>I drew the famine series almost feverishly. Why did I do that? Why did I at all draw those sketches? It was from a sense of anger and of protest that I sketched the famine scenes. It was my statement against the situation, terrible human sufferings, which I thought and still think was created by man, man-causing sufferings for man. I only tried to record my opinion and feelings."</p>
